- **Google Gemini API** integration  
- **Anthropic Claude API** integration
- Built-in settings panel for secure authentication
- Local encrypted token storage with automatic refresh
- Modular architecture for future AI agent additions

### 4. Side Chat Interface
- Resizable sidebar within browser window
- Real-time interaction with selected AI agents
- Authenticated API token usage for queries
- Clean, minimal UI focused on chat experience

### 5. Rendering & Interaction
- Real-time HTML parsing via Puppeteer
- Screenshot capabilities for AI analysis
- AI-driven page interactions (clicks, forms, navigation)
- Direct integration between AI agents and browser automation

### 6. Performance Optimization
- Stripped-down Chromium build
- Configurable process limits
- Headless mode toggle
- Resource monitoring and optimization

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- **Node.js** for Puppeteer runtime
- **Electron** for cross-platform app packaging
- **Puppeteer** for browser automation
- **OpenAI SDK** for ChatGPT integration
- **Google AI SDK** for Gemini integration
- **Anthropic SDK** for Claude integration

### Security
- macOS Keychain integration for secure token storage

## Use Case Flow
1. User launches the AI-Agent Browser
2. User configures AI integrations via settings panel
3. User authenticates with OpenAI/Gemini/Claude services
4. Tokens are securely stored in macOS Keychain
5. User navigates to any webpage
6. Sidebar opens for AI chat interface
7. User queries AI about current webpage (e.g., "Summarize this page")
8. Puppeteer captures page data and sends to AI
9. AI processes request and responds with actionable insights
10. AI can instruct browser to perform actions (clicks, navigation, etc.)

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: < 200MB RAM usage with single tab
- **Security**: Zero token exposure in logs or storage
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for AI integrations
- **User Experience**: < 2 second response time for AI queries
- **Compatibility**: Support for 95%+ of modern websites
